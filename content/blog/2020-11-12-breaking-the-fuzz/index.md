I hate to admit it, but I am developing a bit of a trend.

It's a mental health trend.

One where for several weeks or a month at a time I am down and out.

- No exercise
- Eating badly
- Not enjoying my day at work
- Questioning every thought on my mind

One thing has proven itself twice now:

> Getting up early and at the same time _every day_.

I raise at **7am** whether or not I need to. I do it if I have no plans. I'll
just sit upstairs with no idea and wait for the mood to take me.

## A Morning Raising at 7

Before I know it the kettle is on. Might as well have a brew. Might as well ask
Jane if she wants a brew. Watch a little TV. Read a little Hacker News. Look
into that programming idea I had. Go for a walk.
Go for a run.

Most of that can be achieved in 2 hours before work (Caveat: no kids). Not all
of it, sometimes only the brew and a little tele.

**It's a casual easy morning by default.**

##Â A Morning Raising _For Work_

Compare that to a morning where you get up just for work. The minimal is done.
Just enough time to get washed and dressed. Not quite enough time for breakfast.
No time for any hobbies or exercise.

This means you start a day's work on the wrong foot. Compound the fact you might
not be enjoying your days at work at the moment. You have a big problem.

The end of your working day you will have catching up to do. What's worse is
you probably pick up a little energy in the evening and cannot get to sleep.

**It's a stressful and unwanted morning by default.**

## Get up to go to Sleep

I get up in the morning because it sets the day in motion. I sleep better. My
breakfast is at a regular time. I have more time for exercise.

These 3 things alone are fundamental to feel good literally and feeling good
about yourself.

## Tips

1. Keep it going at the weekend - There is a TV programme at 7am on Sunday which is a guilty pleasure of mine, I watch that every week.
2. No phones in the bedroom. You've heard this one before. It really works.
3. No snooze on the alarm! If you know this is your 1-and-only alarm then you better stay up.
4. Put your exercise gear out by your phone in the evening - when you wake up put it on.
5. Do not worry about getting to bed. The 1st day might be a little rough, but after that it is automatic... You will be tired.

I hope all of this helps someone one day. I'm feeling better just a few days
into revisiting this way of being.

Works wonders mate.

Keep it up.
