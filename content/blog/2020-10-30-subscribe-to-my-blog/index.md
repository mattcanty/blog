I just subscribed to my own blog. I thought you might like to as well. Or not.

You'll do what you'll do.

If you have a feed reader, then this is what you want:

`https://blog.mattcanty.com/rss.xml`

Otherwise, I'd recommend something free and simple like _Feedrabbit_. Use this link
once you have an account set up: [https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https://blog.mattcanty.com/rss.xml](https://feedrabbit.com/subscriptions/new?url=https%3A%2F%2Fblog.mattcanty.com%2Frss.xml)

Easy as that.
