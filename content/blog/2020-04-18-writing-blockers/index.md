title: Writing Blockers

  I want to write. Not neccessarily to be a writer, but to simply expose my
  opinion and thoughts on work and life. I generally find this hard. Here I
  identify those blockers; and aim to address them.

I had a spate of writing from when I moved to London, until I finished a number
of cycling challenges around 2013. I have always looked back with a fondness to
write more, but always faced some challenges.

Noted quickly, off the top of my head:

- Subject matters
- Caution of writing about proprietary stuff
- Not having the time
- Too difficult to get started
- Feeling like what I have to say surely can't be important to anyone
  - So why bother writing in the first place
- Timeliness

I will write about these in the order that they are addressed.

## Timeliness

I have often found there something sticky about writing a blog. Why is it dated
and what if I wish to change my opinion on something.

I've been inspired by [_My blog is a digial garden, not a blog (Joel Hooks)_][1]
who was in turn inspired by [B*uilding a digital garden (Tom Critchlow*)][2].

What these 2 demonstrate is that there is another way to organise thoughts.

Date is arbitrary in a way. I'm happy to write about something one day, but I
expect to eventually change my mind, and want to be free to update the
point-of-vew.

From now on, this is not a blog. It is my _personal website_. Whatever that
means. I don't even need to decide now, I'll come back to that!

## Too Difficult to Get Started

I'll admit this next section may only be appropriate for those who know a bit of
programming.

I don't make it easy for myself...

I write everything as _plain text_, if you are not sure what that looks like
then take a quick look at this posts [raw content on GitHub][3]! You see what I
mean?

There is also a bit of house keeping in order to start a new post, not just a
simple click of a button. Therefore I have written a script which quicklycreates
a template for now posts - [check it out][4]!

## What I Say Isn't Important to Anyone

All that matters from now in is whether I am interested in what I am writing.

**More to come.**
